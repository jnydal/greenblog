What is greenblog?
******************

greenblog is a free blog built for the app engine plattform, and is based on django.


Why another blog?
*******************************

The reason why I made this one, was because of the _slow_ application initialtion time
due to googles resource saving policy for small trafficated pages - because we know java is a demanding plattform.
And I must say - wow - python is really fun! and also much faster to develop in than java - a perfect choice for app engine.


How to install:
***************

Just deply via app engine deply tool.
